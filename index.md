## About 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a linguist at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. After my studies in Germanic Linguistics and Spanish Philology, I wrote my dissertation on the syntax and semantics of NPs in Spanish and German in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Until now, I have worked as a researcher at the Universität Potsdam, in the Collaborative Research Center (CRC 632) "Information Structure" at the Freie Universität Berlin, at the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, and at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. Currently, I am a PI in the Collaborative Research Center (CRC 1412) "Registers". 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am interested in the interface between morphosyntax and semantics, in particular in change of state expressions and NPs; in formal modeling of morphosyntactic variation in the context of register differences; in Differential Object Marking; and in LaTeX, among other topics. Languages I have worked on are: German, Mandarin Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, French, and Spanish.
